# Multi-scale Low Rank Matrix Decomposition Code
This is a collection of codes in C to reproduce some of
the results that are described in the paper:
Frank Ong and Michael Lustig
"Beyond Low Rank + Sparse: Multi-scale Low Rank Matrix Decomposition"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08751

You are encouraged to modify or distribute this code in any way you want. 
However, please acknowledge this code and cite the papers appropriately. 
For any questions about the code, please contact me (Frank Ong) at:

##C Demos:

The C demo uses the Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (included as a submodule)
